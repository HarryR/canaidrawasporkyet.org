# Can AI Draw a Spork Yet?

That is the question: can a simple spork defeat the turing test?

## Adding Sporks

Images must be 512x512px square, JPEG under 100kb.

Add them to `index.html`, under the `header` tag, and submit as a PR.

```html
  ...
</header>

<hgroup>
  <h2>Month YEAR: [Yes|No] (AI-Name)</h2>
  <img width=512 height=512 src="img/20YY/M/ainame.jpg" />
</hgroup>
```
